            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the Chromebook jailbreak guide! This is a complete guide to remove school/enterprise restrictions on your chromebook.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>(For support, join the <a href="https://discord.gg/TyW4SUsZ9r">Unblocked Cave</a> Discord server.)</li>
                <br />

                <li>MAKE SURE TO READ EVERYTHING HERE! THIS IS IMPORTANT INFORMATION!</li>
            </ul>
            <h1>The Fog/Tsunami...</h1>
            <h3>Everyone should read this, if you are very new to chromebook exploiting you may not understand these terms.</h3>

            <p>
                If you are getting errors whenever you are attempting to unenroll with Sh1mmer, your chromebook probably has the fog. The fog is a patch made by Google to try and prevent enrollment escapes. There is two ways to unenroll
                during the fog. One way is to disable WP by either removing the WP screw/disconnecting the battery and plugging in a charger and changing the GBB flags in Sh1mmer's bash shell. The other way is to use another project called
                <a href="https://fog.gay">RecoMod/E-Halcyon</a>. It will allow you to temporarily boot into a unenrolled v107 session.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now if the above steps didn't work, you either did something wrong when disabling WP (check if WP is disabled with command "flashrom --wp-status") or you actually are Tsunamied. The Tsunami is another patch by Google
                preventing you from disabling WP on enrolled devices. However there is a way around this, it is done by briding pins 3 and 8 on your Chromebooks BIOS/Firmware SOIC-8 chip. This is complicated so I will explain this in full
                detail <a href="tsunami.html">here</a>. You can also use a CH341A mini programmer to flash custom firmware to your device. (Oh yeah and E-Halcyon works on this version too).
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Please note, the full tutorials on how to bypass both of these patches are here: <a href="fog.html">Fog</a>, <a href="tsunami.html">Tsunami</a>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>SO BEFORE CONTINUING!</h1>

            <h2>Check your version:</h2>
            <h3>Visit <a href="chrome://version">chrome://version</a></h3>
            <p>Once you are at the website <a href="chrome://version">chrome://version</a>, the first three numbers after "<strong>Google Chrome:</strong>" are your version. Remember those three numbers.</p>
            <img src="version.png" alt="Example of chrome://version" />

            <h1>What is enterprise management?</h1>
            <p>
                Enterprise management is how schools or buisnesses manage Chromebooks. They can provision devices to be locked down/restricted, so people use there device purely for work. What this guide is about is
                deprovisioning/unenrolling your Chromebook. It will remove all of those restrictions and act just as if your Chromebook is a brand new, fresh out the box Chromebook.
            </p>

            <h1>All unenrolling methods:</h1>
            <p>This is a list of all of the unenrolling methods.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://sh1mmer.me">Sh1mmer</a> - Patched v111 (downgrade to v110 if you are v111)</li>
                <li><a href="javascript:alert('TODO');">UNROLL</a> - Downgrade to v80, v101, v87, v91.</li>
                <li><a href="https://fog.gay">RecoMod/E-Halcyon</a> - Unpatched, any version.</li>
                <li><a href="https://osu.bio/sh1mmer/unfog/">GBB Flags</a> - Patched in v114, make sure you have a leaked RMA shim.</li>
                <li><a href="javascript:alert('TODO');">Pencil Method</a> - Unpatched, bridge pins 3 and 8 on SOIC-8 flash chip.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Disabling extensions:</h1>
            <p>Some enterprises use extensions in Google Chrome such as Securly or GoGuardian. These are used to block/filter what websites we are going to. With some exploits, you can disable the extensions filtering the content.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="ltmeat.html">LTMEAT</a> - Patched in v114, chrome://kill and chrome://hang unblocked.</li>
                <li><a href="dextensify.html">Dextensify</a> - Unpatched</li>
            </ul>
